Mentor Guide:<br>
You can offer another character your mentoring by opening <font color="LEVEL">Contacts (Alt+Y)</font> and clicking on <font color="LEVEL">Button +</font> In the section <font color="LEVEL">Mentoring.</font><br>

For example, if you become a mentor, you will be able to choose characters in the Mentoring window who will be your Disciples.<br>

But not every character can become a Mentor or Apprentice. <font color="LEVEL">Mentor</font> must pass <font color="LEVEL">Rebirth</font> and be <font color="LEVEL"> Level 105 and above. Student</font> must be <font color="LEVEL">below level 104.</font><br>

If a student has completed a course, the mentor cannot take other students for 1 day. After the break of the relationship with the student, the mentor can not receive another student within 2 days.<br>
