Fisherman Fibbs: <br>
The special bait of Hein is an amazing thing! Lately, many have become addicted to fishing, and some started to make different things to fish. <br>
Oh Gods! Excuse me, I'm a little distracted, In general, if you fish with the special bait of Hein, then sometimes you can pull the Chests from the Treasures out of the water. The oddity is that they only come across a special bait of Hein. <br>
Maybe this is the will of the fishing god? Who knows ... Oh, I'm distracted again! In Heine, many fishermen gather. Maybe one of them invented this bait. Not so important as it appeared, the main thing is that it works. <br>
It's interesting, is not it? Be sure to try fishing with the special bait of Hain!
