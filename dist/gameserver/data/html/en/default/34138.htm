Head of the Guild of Fishermen of Santiago: <br>
Today is a wonderful day for fishing !. <br>
Although for her there are no bad days. And in the cloudy and sunny weather nice to sit by the river with a fishing rod ... <br>
Oh, I completely forgot to introduce myself, my name is Santiago, I'm the new Head of the Guild of Fishermen. Before I became the head of the guild, I was a simple fisherman, loved to go out into the open sea and fish there. <br>
By the way, you in your travels did not find the Treasure Map Graft? I can exchange 5 scraps of cards with numbers 1-4 and one scrap number 5 on the Treasure Chest<br>
