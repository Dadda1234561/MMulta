Master Jeweler Dyne ： <br>
Interested in Fallen Angel accessories? The Fallen Angel is a creature born of the Chaos God Gran Cain. Unfortunately, I don’t know anything more about him. <br>
But recently, <font color = "LEVEL"> Fallen Angel's accessories were found </font> It is still not completely clear how the accessories could be nourished by the power of this creature, but the magicians examined them and created the <font color = "LEVEL"> Scroll of the Fallen Angel Accessories Modification </font> This item can enhance the accessories of the Fallen Angel. <br>
 Using the scroll is simple, but you won’t reach the top of the modification with it. If you want, you can bring me the <font color = "LEVEL"> Ring of the Fallen Angel of modification +9 and above </font> and I will seal it. <br>
<Button ALIGN=LEFT ICON="NORMAL" action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_ring9">Seal the Fallen Angel's Ring +9</Button> 
<Button ALIGN=LEFT ICON="NORMAL" action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_ring10">Seal the Fallen Angel's Ring +10</Button> 
<Button ALIGN="LEFT" ICON="RETURN" action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_Chat 0">Back</Button>
