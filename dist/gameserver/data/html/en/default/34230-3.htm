Head of the Sforza Ranger: <br>
A few materials are needed to create the Blackbird Clan Talisman. The most important of them is the Demon Crystal. <br>
The easiest way to get it is by completing one of our assignments and receiving the Box of Supplies as a reward. Then you will only have to collect the remaining materials, and for a small fee we will produce for you the Blackbird Clan Talisman! <br>
This talisman is a sign of special gratitude to those who help our clan. Haha!<br>
