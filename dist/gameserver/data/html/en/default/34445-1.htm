The effect of the available accessories can be made even stronger by finishing. Finishing requires <font color = "LEVEL"> Selenite </font> and <font color = "LEVEL"> Solvent for Accessories </font>. <br>
To get Selenite, you must dissolve the accessory. Just keep in mind that in this case he will disappear forever. <br>
But upon completion, all <font color = "LEVEL"> other characteristics of the accessories are stored </font>, so if you change your mind, you can easily return the item to its previous state. Like this! What do you want? <br>
