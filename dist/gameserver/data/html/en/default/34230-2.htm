Head of the Sforza Ranger: <br>
Anyone who helps our clan can get a special Blackbird Clan Talisman. We made it specially for you. Also we can improve it. But for this, special materials are needed, and they are quite rare. <br>
Therefore ... If you want to get a talisman, you will have to find these materials. The easiest way to get them is to carry out our assignments. So dare to!<br>
