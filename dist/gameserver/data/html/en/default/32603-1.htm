Officer Tepios:<br>
<font color = "LEVEL"> Seed of Immortality </font> is the territory governed by the Shilen guard <font color = "LEVEL"> Ecimus </font>. <br>

I will share with you valuable information that we have obtained through many victims. Seed <font color = "LEVEL"> looks like a single living organism, all parts are connected. </font> How the whole body suffers, if only one organ fails, and the Seed of Immortality will get damage if you destroy monsters in one part. <br>

But if someone dies inside, then the Seed is saturated with his death and becomes stronger. <br>

I think now you can understand why we <font color = "LEVEL"> let in only worthy soldiers. </font><br>
