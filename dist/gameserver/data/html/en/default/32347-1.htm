Do you have the Elegant Brooch of Lavirosis? In this case, the brooch can be improved and make it dazzling! A dazzling Brooch can be enchanted with the help of <font color="LEVEL">Spirit Stone for the Dazzling Brooch</font>! Well? Impressive, is not it?
<br>
And if you also have and <font color="LEVEL">Gem for Dazzling Brooch</font>, then you can make a dazzling Brooch even stronger! Improvement can give her rare spells!
<br>
But this requires special material. It is called <font color="LEVEL">Powder from the Precious Stone Lavianroz</font>.If you bring me <font color="LEVEL">1 Grindstone</font>, and <font color="LEVEL">Casket with Gems</font> or <font color="LEVEL">Precious Stone Level 1</font>, I will exchange them for <font color="LEVEL">Powder from the Precious Stone</font>. And by the way, the type of gemstone does not matter.
