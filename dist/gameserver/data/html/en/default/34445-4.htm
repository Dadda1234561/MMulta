You can exchange the Beginning Ring for a more powerful high-level item using the <font color = "LEVEL"> Emperor Power Source </font>, which you will receive in exchange for <font color = "LEVEL"> Helios, Ramona, Mimir, Core accessories and Harnack. </font> <br>
However, keep in mind that when receiving new accessories <font color = "LEVEL"> the gain and level of modification are not saved. </font> But if everything goes well, you will get much more powerful items. <br>
