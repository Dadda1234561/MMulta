Everyone admires the fiery speech of Leonie Blackbird! Behind her, we'll go to the end of the world. And without delay, sacrifice life, if only it would bring us closer to the goal. <br>
Our clan will eradicate the slave trade on the Isle of Hell! We will check every ship in the port, we will inspect every suspicious house in the district. There are rumors that somewhere on the island put cruel experiments on living beings. It is necessary to stop this. You understand the situation?<br>
