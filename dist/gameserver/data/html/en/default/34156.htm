Fisherman Fibbs: <br>
Wow! Hello! My name is Phoebs. I'm a fisherman. <br>
From early childhood, parents said that fishing is too dangerous ... But I really like it. Is it possible to refuse such a pleasant lesson? Hehehehe.<br>
Do not want to go fishing? By the way, you heard about <font color="LEVEL">Special Bait of Hein and the Shining Magic Bait</font>?<br>
I can exchange them for <font color="LEVEL">bait coupon</font>.<br>
Oh yes! This time I managed to get a special bait. If you collect <font color="LEVEL">Hain's Fishing Coins</font>, then I will exchange them for <font color="LEVEL">Elite Fishing Rod</font>. A real fisherman should not miss such a chance!<br>
Coins can be found in <font color="LEVEL">Chest of Hein with Treasures and the Shining Magic Chest</font>, which can be caught on <font color="LEVEL">The special bait of Hain and the Brilliant Magic Bait</font>.<br>
