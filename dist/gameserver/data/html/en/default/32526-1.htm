The Seed of Destruction can be called a huge fortress. To break into it, it is necessary to destroy many different obstacles on the way. Of course the neighborhood is guarded by a lot of dragon soldiers. <br>

However, you can not hesitate. If we do not act quickly, the dragon will again take over the fortress. Therefore, we need to develop <font color="LEVEL">the invasion plan as quickly as possible</font>
