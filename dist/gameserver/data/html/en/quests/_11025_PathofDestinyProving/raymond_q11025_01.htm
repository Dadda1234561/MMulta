Friend... I've been waiting for you.<br>
An object determined to be from the Wind Spirit Realm was found in the vicinity of the Town of Gludio.<br>
We asked the Ertheia delegation to investigate since they were in area, but they didn't stay for long.<br>
Another member of the delegation left to investigate alone.<br>
