		Molly: <br>
		I was supposed to meet you, but Kelbim ordered me to follow my every step, and I had to lie low. I asked Angora to go instead of me, because I trust her. It seems that she did everything right and accurately conveyed my words to you. <br>
		Once you are here, it means that you have managed to impose a seal on the altars. Good job! Now you need to deal with Kelbim. <br>
		Rather, set me free. We must destroy Kelbim before he finds out about everything and begins to act..<br>
