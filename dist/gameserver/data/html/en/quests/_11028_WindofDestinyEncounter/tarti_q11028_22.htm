Telesha had it?.. That's weird. Probably means something. It's no coincidence that this object was there!<br>
We need to study it. Thanks for your help! If it wasn't for you, we would've never learned what happened to Telesha.<br>
Her death is a great loss... The only silver lining is that I'm now sure that you are ready for a <font color="LEVEL">second class change</font>.<br>
Do you want to do it right now?<br>
