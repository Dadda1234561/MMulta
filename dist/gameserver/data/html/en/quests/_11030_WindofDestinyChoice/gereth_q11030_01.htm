What brings you here? Oh! That Prophecy Device... Were you not able to meet up with Kain? He had come all the way here to find you...you must've just missed each other.<br>
I told him that you were off to verify some information on the Prophecy Machine and he said he'd wait for you, but...<br>
Were you able to wrap up your work on the Prophecy Machine?<br>
