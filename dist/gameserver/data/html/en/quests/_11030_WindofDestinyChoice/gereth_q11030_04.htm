<font color="LEVEL">When the god's voice will no longer be heard.</font><br>
<font color="LEVEL">A red river flows...</font><br>
<font color="LEVEL">Hard frost upon the earth... And one of half-noble blood, descending with the winds to become the prophesied one.</font><br>
<font color="LEVEL">Your lonely, solitary journey has begun. A small child in the middle of a blocked road appears. When joined by one of nobility, the path will open to the Grail.</center><br>
So it wasn't a coincidence that you left on your journey.<br>
