Adventure Guildsman:<br>
This world seethes with violence and corruption. Though Einhasad taught peace and healing and Eva extolled nature and harmony, it is all for naught if no brave soul will step forth to lead by example.<br>
The Adventure Guild is here to help those who step forth. We are also here to exchange the <font color="LEVEL">Adventurer's Marks and Seals</font> that you get from your adventures.<br>
Brave people like you will be able to bring forth peace onto this world. Would you like to hear the voices of those who are in need of help?<br>
