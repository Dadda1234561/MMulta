Adventure Guildsman:<br>
Pleased to meet you! I'm an information officer from the Adventure Guild. I have news of the world's happenings for those like you. My goal is to aid you in your search for adventures!<br>
I can also help you exchange your <font color="LEVEL">Adventurer's Marks and Seals</font>.<br>
Well, time to get started. How can I help you?<br>
