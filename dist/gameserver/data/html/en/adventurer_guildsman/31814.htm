Adventure Guildsman:<br>
Welcome! Is there anything you want to ask?<br>
Information is as valuable to an adventurer as power or courage! You won't get far if you don't know where the monsters and treasure are.<br>
Listen carefully!<br>
And don't forget to come find me to exchange your <font color="LEVEL">Adventurer's Marks and Seals</font> that you'll get thanks to that information!<br>
