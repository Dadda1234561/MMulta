Adventure Guildsman:<br>
Do you seek thrill and suspense? Adventures aren't always full of those, you know. Wealth and fame take effort and time. My guild deals in information regarding adventures all over the world.<br>
I can also help you exchange your <font color="LEVEL">Adventurer's Marks and Seals</font>.<br>
It looks like you are here for something. May Eva's blessing be with you.<br>
