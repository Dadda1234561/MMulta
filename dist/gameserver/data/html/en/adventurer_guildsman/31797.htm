Adventure Guildsman:<br>
Welcome! Romance, adventure, the thrill of peril, dreams of overnight fortunes... My guild's information can make all of that come true!<br>
That's not all. We are also exchanging <font color="LEVEL">Adveneturer's Marks and Seals</font> that you get from your adventures.<br>
Believe me, I've got some adventures that will knock your socks off! In fact, I've got one that's perfect for you!<br>
