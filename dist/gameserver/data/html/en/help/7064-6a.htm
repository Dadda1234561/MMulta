Diary of Lydia: <br> <br>
The thirtieth day of the month of Shilen. <br> <br> <br>
Tomorrow is an important day!
I could not talk to the Father.
The word Nidrah'a now has too much value! <br> <br>
The royal leadership of Run'ah is weakened for an eternity, and something must have happened!
Brother Eilhalder said that our family first of all should stand up for the protection of Run'y, and not the royal family! <br> <br>
I'm not sure, and I do not believe in all this ... <br> <br>
Nidrah came to me this evening.
He told me that no matter what I decided, I should always show my courage during a terrible time.
What did he mean by that?
I've always been brave!<br><br>
