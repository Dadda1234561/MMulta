Diary of Lydia: <br> <br>
Deep Darkness <br> <br>
The light of stars is reflected in his smile. <br> <br>
He talks about courage, but I do not know where and even who I am! <br> <br>
Can a mad person be able to be brave? Who knows? <br> <br>
His laughter is heard, and again, the word boldness.
Other words, but they are in a different language, I do not understand. <br> <br>
The Dark Magician with his smile speaks softly to me, holding my hands in the dark night. <br> <br>
Courage.
Courage.
Courage.
Nothing matters anymore. <br> <br>
My ceremony is still being prepared!
What's going on here so late??<br><br>
