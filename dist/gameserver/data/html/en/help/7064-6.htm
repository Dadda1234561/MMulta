Diary of Lydia: <br> <br>
Twenty-fourth day of Shilen. <br> <br> <br>
My invitation to Nidrah was delivered quickly, and it was too easy! <br> <br>
I was in such a hurry when I was preparing for his arrival!
I had to make a thousand mistakes, but he did not complain!
Was he too cute?
Or maybe he just does not care! <br> <br>
He told me that he was here on business;
and this business does not have anything in common with our family.<br><br>
