The Life of Solina - The Royal Archives of Aden: <br>
The arrogant emperor Bayum openly opposed Einhasad, he desired to free himself from the intervention of the gods and become God himself. To gain eternal life and immortality, he began to build a huge tower, challenging the goddess Einhasad. Immeasurably cruel was the fate of the emperor, who dared to resist the all-powerful goddess. <br>
Baiyum, who was puffed up, was cursed by Einhasad and other gods and imprisoned in the tower built by himself. He became a creature unknown to the world, which is neither a person, nor an evil spirit, nor a god. He found not eternal life, and immortality, the unfortunate now can not dispose of either his life or his death. Later people called this bath the Tower of Insolence. It serves as an illustrative example showing how irrational is the resistance of a man to the great gods.<br>
