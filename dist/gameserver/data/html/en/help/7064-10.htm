Diary of Lydia: <br> <br>
I do not understand why I'm here!
It seems he knows all my secret secrets!
He asked me what I did not want to leave.
I was honest with him, but I can not remember what I said.
All that was ... I lost it!
Do what really happens?
He asks me to give myself all this!
He accuses me of betraying my family, my life, my god and even the natural law!<br><br>
