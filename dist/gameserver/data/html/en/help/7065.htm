Letter for Lydia: <br> <br>
Thank you for finding our family treasure!
I want to thank you personally!
I watched you, even if I knew ... I would not ...!
By the way, do you have my magic hairpin?
I think I lost it after working with one magician, I heard that she had you.
If you have it please send it to me.<br><br>
