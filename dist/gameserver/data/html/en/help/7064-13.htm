Diary of Lydia: <br> <br>
[Another handwriting] <br> <br>
I do not understand!
Obviously, I wrote this, but I do not remember!
I will look into the mirror and see her face, reflected in me, but there is no mirror!
Only the image.
I do not understand what's going on here!
Where is my memory?
They seem to be there, but it's reckless!
He must do something to me! <br> <br>
Everything that happened is written down, but forgotten!
Both regret it and get satisfaction from it
The Moon Flower on your hairpin will complete this contract.<br><br>
