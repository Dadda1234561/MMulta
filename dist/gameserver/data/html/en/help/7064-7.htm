Diary of Lydia: <br> <br>
Everyone is dead.
I finally was able to see Nidrah, using some terrible tricks I will not disclose here!
I just have to see it!
Only he was my hope!
He will agree to meet me even if I come during the rite!
He reminded me of what he had told me earlier.
He says that I should be brave and act!
I'm sure now that time is right!<br><br>
